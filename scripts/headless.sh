#
# Two things stand between a checkout and any of those: an Electron this machine
# can execute, and a screen to draw on. A headless runner has neither, and
# without this each caller would carry the same two workarounds — `xvfb-run`
# around the command, and on NixOS an `ELECTRON_EXEC_PATH` pointing somewhere
# the npm download is not.
#
# A desktop has both, and the screen it has is the wrong one: see `on_desktop`.
# So the screen is this script's either way, and a suite that passes here passes
# on the runner for the same reasons.
#
# Both callers need both. `test:app` drives a real window through the DevTools
# protocol; `screenshots` renders off screen and still needs a display to do it,
# Electron on Linux having nothing to initialise a GPU process against without
# one. So there is no flag here for wanting one and not the other.
#
# Nothing is installed. What is missing is borrowed from nixpkgs for the length
# of the run, which is also why nix is only asked for when something is actually
# missing: a machine that has what it needs never learns this script can do that.
#
# Not for `npm run dev`, which also starts Electron. That opens a window
# somebody is going to look at, and the whole business below ends by putting the
# window somewhere nobody can see it. What it wants from here is the binary
# alone, which `.envrc` already gives it.
